I joined UIUCTF 2025 with CyberwireZ, and we solved 13 challenges. The challenges included in this writeup are the ones I personally worked on, as part of my goal to learn and have fun solving problems.

This writeup is a collection of those challenges, how I approached them, and what I learned along the way. I’m sharing it in case it helps others or inspires new ideas for tackling similar problems.

# OSINT

### cherry_blossom

Download the file and check the image.

Upon seeing the cherry blossoms, it’s clear they’re fake. Check the position of the car it’s parked in an elevated area, suggesting it wasn’t just randomly parked there. Could this be a car museum?

While searching for unique car museums, I came across this gem.

The spot can be the possible location, second floor and look at the roof.

# Web

### ruler of the universe

![](/assets/img/ruler.jpg){: .mx-auto .d-block width="400px" }

Download the file and inspect the source code.

As seen in the Dockerfile, the application runs index.tsx using Bun:

```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:alpine

COPY src/bun.lock src/package.json /src/
RUN cd /src/ && bun install --frozen-lockfile

COPY ./src/ /src/

USER bun
WORKDIR /src/
CMD [ "bun", "index.tsx" ]
```

Looking into index.tsx, we find the following route definition:

```javascript
"/module/:id": {
  GET: (req) => {
    const moduleId = parseInt(req.params.id);
    const crewMessage = new URL(req.url).searchParams.get("message");

    return new Response(
      render(
        <App>
          <Module id={moduleId} crewMessage={crewMessage} />
        </App>
      ),
      {
        headers: { "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=utf-8" },
      }
    );
  },
},
```

Here, the application extracts a message query parameter from the URL and passes it directly to the Module component via `crewMessage`. Since there is no sanitization or escaping, this opens the door to **reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.

For example, an attacker could craft the following URL:

```
/module/1?message=<script>EXPLOIT</script>
```

Now let's try to inject the vulnerability in this page.

Try to inject an XSS payload to display the cookie, Thanks ChatGPT lol.

![](/assets/img/xss.jpg){: .mx-auto .d-block }

I’m using webhook to catch the response.

# Crypto

### shortest crypto challenge

![](/assets/img/shortestcrypto1.png){: .mx-auto .d-block width="400px" }

Download the file and check the Python script.

The script is this:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from hashlib import md5
from secret import a,b,c,d, FLAG

assert a**4 + b**4 == c**4 + d**4 + 17 and max(a,b,c,d) < 2e4 and AES.new( f"{a*b*c*d}".zfill(16).encode() , AES.MODE_ECB).encrypt(FLAG).hex() == "41593455378fed8c3bd344827a193bde7ec2044a3f7a3ca6fb77448e9de55155"
```

The challenge gives a Python script that encrypts a flag using AES-ECB. Four integers (a, b, c, d) satisfy:

```
a^4 + b^4 = c^4 + d^4 + 17
```

with `max(a,b,c,d) < 20000`. The AES key is the product `a*b*c*d`, padded to 16 digits. Ciphertext is:

```
41593455378fed8c3bd344827a193bde7ec2044a3f7a3ca6fb77448e9de55155
```

We need to find (a,b,c,d), compute the key, and decrypt the flag. The script below solves the challenge.
