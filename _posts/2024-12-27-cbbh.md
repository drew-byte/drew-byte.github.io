Thank you, 2024. It’s been full of memories—many disappointments, many people I’ve met, and many who are still here believing in me. I won’t mention names, you know who you are.  

**Thank you papis.**

## How to pass the CBBH Examination

1. Finish all modules of CBBH, and even if you've completed them, do the assessment if you're unsure. 
2. Use the global search in HTB Academy while taking the exam; it can be really helpful if you've forgotten something.
3. Use AI to assist with your report, and the CVSS calculator for scoring.  
4. Ensure thorough reconnaissance and complete information about the target to avoid missing anything.
5. If not confident, practice labs from PortSwigger Academy or set up labs from VulnHub.
6. Take breaks to avoid burnout.
7. Black Coffee :>
