On **October 25, 2024**, I had the honor of representing the **Philippines** at the **Cyber SEA Games** held in Thailand. This international event brought together the top cybersecurity talents from across Southeast Asia, creating a highly competitive environment that tested both technical skills and teamwork under pressure.  

Our team secured **7th place overall**, a result that reflected not only our knowledge but also our resilience and determination to perform on an international stage. The competition exposed us to diverse challenges in areas such as digital forensics, reverse engineering, incident response, and network defense, giving us valuable insights into how other countries approach cybersecurity.
