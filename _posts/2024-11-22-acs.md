From **November 19–22, 2024**, I had the privilege of representing the **Philippines** at the **ASEAN Cyber Shield (ACS)** competition held in Vietnam. This event brought together some of the most talented cybersecurity teams across Southeast Asia, creating a highly competitive and collaborative environment.  

Our team placed **15th overall**, and while we didn’t finish at the top, the experience was truly invaluable. Competing against regional teams allowed us to test our skills in real-world cybersecurity scenarios, refine our problem-solving strategies under pressure, and learn new techniques from some of the best minds in the field.  

Beyond the technical challenges, this was a memorable journey on a personal level as well. Spending a full week in Vietnam gave us the chance not only to prepare and compete but also to experience a new culture, strengthen our teamwork, and create lasting memories that went far beyond the competition itself.
