In **October 2024**, our team proudly achieved the title of **Hack4Gov 3 National Champion**.  
This journey began at the **NCR Regional Championship**, where we competed against strong university teams from across the region. After securing first place, we earned the opportunity to represent NCR at the national levelâ€”a milestone that pushed us to prepare, strategize, and refine our skills even further.  

The **national round** brought together the best teams from all regions of the Philippines, each showcasing their cybersecurity expertise across various challenges such as digital forensics, malware analysis, reverse engineering, incident response, and network defense. The competition was intense, testing both our technical knowledge and our ability to perform under pressure.  

Through teamwork, collaboration, and persistence, we rose to the challenge and emerged as **National Champions of Hack4Gov 3**. This achievement represents not only our technical growth but also the dedication and countless hours of preparation that went into reaching this level.
