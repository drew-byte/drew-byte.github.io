In November 2023, I participated in the University CTF Nationwide hosted by Trend Micro in the Philippines. This was my first official achievement as I began pursuing a career in cybersecurity.

The competition provided a valuable opportunity to apply technical skills in real-world scenarios, collaborate with teammates under pressure, and solve challenges across areas such as cryptography, reverse engineering, web exploitation, and digital forensics. More than just a competition, it was a learning experience that helped me build confidence and motivated me to continue growing in this field.
